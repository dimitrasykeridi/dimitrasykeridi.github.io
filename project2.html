									<p>This project involves analyzing Airbnb data related to Listings, Reviews, and Bookings using PowerBI. </p>
								
									<h3> The Opportunity:</h3>
									<p> The objective was to collect data from Airbnb's official website, clean and transform the data, create dashboards and visualizations, and generate insights using Microsoft PowerBI.</p>
								
									<h4>Step 1 : Data Extraction and Loading</h4>
									<p>The data are from the official site of Airbnb and they are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. 
									The extracted data was loaded into Microsoft PowerBI to design a dashboard from scratch. </p>
								            
								<!-- Start: The rest of the steps. You can copy the code below as much times as the steps of the project -->
									<h4>Step 2 : Data Cleaning </h4>
									<p>In the data cleaning process, one key task was correcting data types. The next step was handling null values, which were replaced with character values or by converting "false" and "true" to numeric values. We also extracted a new column from an existing one using a delimiter.</p>
									
								<!-- End: The rest of the steps. You can copy the code below as much times as the steps of the project -->
								    <h4>Step 2 : Data Transformations </h4>
									<p> Using PowerQuery, we created DAX measures to simplify the process of deriving insights by applying custom calculations. After that, we added conditional columns to categorize the data and enhance dashboard clarity.</p>
								
													
								    <h4> Step 3: Data Modelling </h4>
									<p>During the data modeling process, we verified that all data types were accurate, added data categories, descriptions, and symbols where needed. After setting up the schema by developing fact and dimension tables, we created seven tables, highlighted key columns, and ensured the cardinality was correct.</p>
							
									<h4> Key Insights: </h4>
									<h4> Average Price </h4>
											
												<ul>
												<li><p>The average price per night for an Airbnb listing is €110.</p></li>


												
												<h4>Optimal Pricing Month</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p>September is ideal for increasing prices due to a rise in listings.</p></li>
												</ul>

												
												<h4>Price Trends Over Years</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p> Significant increases in average price were observed in 2008, 2011, 2018, and 2021.</p></li>											
												
												</ul>
												
												<h4> Top Listing Areas</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p> Εμπορικό Τρίγωνο-Πλάκα has the highest number of listings with a price only €30 above the average.</p></li>											
											    <li><p> Ρηγίλλης has the highest average price at €368 per night but ranks top in location reviews.</p></li>		
                                                <li><p> Κουκάκι-Μακρυγιάννη has achieved the highest average review score among the top 10 cities, excelling in check-in, communication, cleanliness, and accuracy.</p></li>	
												</ul>
												
												<h4>Review Trends</h4>
											    <ul>
												<li><p> The highest number of reviews by city is in Εμπορικό Τρίγωνο-Πλάκα with 9,704 reviews.</p></li>											
												<li><p> Reviews peak in May and are lowest in July.</p></li>
												</ul>
												<h4> Listing Types </h4>
											     <ul>
												 
												<li><p> Entire apartments are the most common due to their comfort and affordability.</p></li>											
												
												</ul>
												
												<h4>Superhosts vs. Non-Superhosts </h4>
											     <ul>
												<li><p>Superhosts have 60% more listings and a perfect 100% average response rate compared to non-superhosts.</p></li>											
																																		
												</ul>
											
									<h3>The Outcome:</h3>
									<p> This PowerBI project provided valuable insights into Airbnb listings and reviews across Greece, uncovering key trends and opportunities. The analysis highlighted September as the optimal month for increasing prices, while regional data revealed that Εμπορικό Τρίγωνο-Πλάκα leads in listing volume and Ρηγίλλης excels in location reviews. The project also identified significant seasonal booking trends, showed that entire apartments are the most sought-after accommodation type, and demonstrated that Superhosts, with 60% more listings and a perfect response rate, hold a considerable advantage. These findings offer actionable recommendations for hosts and investors, in order to attract more bookings.</p>
